# My-Second-Project
This program prompts the user for a message and a key for encrypting that message. The key is a positive integer which counts however many spaces to the right from each letter at the input. For example, a letter input of "A" with a key of 2 will be encrypted as "C".  This is my second major project on my journey in programming.

In this program I utilize the ASCII values of each letter inputted by the user and move each character an interval to the right of their paosition in the alphabet determined by the key, or positive integer given by user.
